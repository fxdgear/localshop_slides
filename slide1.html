                  <h3>What is PyPI?</h3>
                  <div class = "left-align">
                    <p>PyPI is pronounced "Pie-p-eye" </br>it stands for the Python Package Index</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>PyPI is different than PyPy which is Python, written in Python. </p>
                  </div>
                </section>

                <!-- Localshop-->
                <section>
                  <h3>Localshop</h3>
                  <h4>Why use localshop</h4>
                  <p>Localshop can be used to privately host your python packages as well as mirror public packages from PyPI.</p>
                  <p>Localshop can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/mvantellingen/localshop">Github</a></p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Why?</h3>
                    <p>Why would you wanna host your own private mirror?</p>
                    <p>At SimpleEnergy we use localshop to host our python package(s). This helps in our deployment.</p>
                    <p>Since we run a PaaS, we build a generic python application that can be pip installed into many different environments.</p>
                    <p>This reduces dependencies on GitHub which can (and does frequently) go down. We don't want to be caught in a situation where mid-deployment GitHub goes down.</p>
                    <p>We can also ensure specific versions of our python packages are installed in any environment.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Getting Setup</h3>
                    <p>The instructions on the Readme for localshop are pretty straight forward, but since we're here we'll cover it anyway.</p>
                    <div class = "left-align">
                    <ol>
                        <li><code>mkvirtualenv localshop</code></li>
                        <li><code>pip install localshop</code></li>
                        <li><code>localshop init</code></li>
                        <li><code>localshop upgrade</code></li>
                    </ol>
                    </div>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Running your localshop</h3>
                    <p>Now that you have localshop installed lets run it to make sure that it's working.</p>
                    <p><pre><code>
(localshop)$ localshop run_gunicorn
(localshop)$ localshop celery worker -B -E
                    </code></pre></p>
                    <p>Now Localshop will be running on port 8000, you can access it by going to <a href="http://localhost:8000">http://localhost:8000</a></p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Create Authentication</h3>
                    <p>Localshop requires credentials as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing">CIDR</a> (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) to allow access to your privately hosted packages</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Credentials: created via the localshop interface is straight forward.</li>
                        <li>CIDR: Used to restrict access to your localshop based on IP addresses.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Using Localshop</h3>
                    <p>Now in order to use localshop you'll have to configure your <code>~/.pyprc</code> file</p>
                    <p><pre><code>
[distutils]
index-servers =
    local

[local]
username: myusername
password: mysecret
repository: http://localhost:8000/simple/
                    </code></pre></p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Upload your package to Localshop</h3>
                    <p>Now we're ready to upload our package to localshop.</p>
                    <p><pre><code>
(localshop)$ python setup.py upload sdist -r local
                    </code></pre></p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Install a package from Localshop</h3>
                    <p>Now that we've published our package to our private localshop, lets install the package to test it out.</p>
                    <p><pre><code>
(localshop)$ pip install -i http://myusername:mysecret@localhost:8000/simple/ localshop
                    </code></pre></p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Installing other packages</h3>
                    <p>When you install other packages using your local mirror, localshop will create a request to PyPI and pass that request through to you.</p>
                    <p>Localshop's celery instance will run in the background to ensure that localshop keeps packages up to date in the background.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Deploying Localshop</h3>
                    <p>Running localshop on a remote server is pretty straight forward using Supervisor.</p>
                    <p>See example supervisor conf file for running the localshop website and celery process.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Example Conf File</h3>
                    <p><pre><code>

                <section>
                    <h3>Starting localshop</h3>
                    <p>Now we've setup our Venv, we've installed Supervisor, and we've set up our localshop supervisor conf file.</p>
                    <p>Using <code>supervisorctl</code> we can look to see the status of our localshop</p>
                    <p><pre><code>
$ sudo supervisorctl status
$ sudo supervisorctl start all
$ sudo supervisorctl restart celery-localshop
                    </code></pre>

                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Using Nginx</h3>
                    <p>If you use nginx, you can create a really simple nginx conf file which will proxy requests from port 80 to your localshop instance.</p>
                    <p><strong>Gotcha</strong> When doing this you need to be sure that you pass along the requesting IP address from nginx to localshop. Localshop will by default recognize requests coming from localshop as coming from <code>0.0.0.0</code>. So if you've set up your CIDR's none of them will work right.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Example Nginx Conf</h3>
                    <p><pre><code>
server {
    listen   80;
    server_name localshop.yourdomain.com;
    root /var/www/localshop/lib/python2.7/site-packages/localshop;
    location /media/ {
        # if asset versioning is used
        if ($query_string) {
            expires max;
        }
    }
    location /static {
        root /var/www/localshop/lib/python2.7/site-packages/localshop;
    }
